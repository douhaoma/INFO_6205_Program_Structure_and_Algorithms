    "\n",
    "iii. **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: A specific implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses breadth-first search to find the shortest augmenting paths, ensuring that the algorithm terminates after a polynomial number of iterations.\n",

    "iv. **Flow Conservation**: A property of nodes in a flow network, excluding the source and sink, where the sum of the flows into a node equals the sum of the flows out of that node.\n",

    "v. **Shortest Path First (SPF) Algorithm**: An algorithm, also known as Dijkstra's algorithm, that finds the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It does this by iteratively selecting the vertex with the shortest tentative distance from the source and relaxing its neighbors. The algorithm assumes all edge weights are non-negative."

Due to an unexpected outbreak of a contagious disease in a city, health officials have identified a set of n individuals who need to be quickly isolated in quarantine facilities. There are k quarantine facilities available in the city, and each of the n individuals needs to be placed in a facility that is within a 20-minute driving time from their residence (hence, different individuals will have different facility options, based on their home locations).\n",
